The **principles of microservices** guide how microservices are designed, developed, deployed, and maintained. These principles help build scalable, resilient, and maintainable distributed systems. Here's a structured breakdown:

---

## ‚úÖ **Core Principles of Microservices**

**SHORT CUT :** 

CC I LORD SSS

C - Communication via apis/messaging

C - continuous delivery/devops alignment

I - independently deployable

L - Language independency for each micro service

O - Observibility - logging, tracing, metrics

R - Resilience

D - decentralized data management

S - Scalability

S - Security

S - single responsibility

### 1. **Single Responsibility / Bounded Context**
- Each microservice should focus on **one business capability**.
- It aligns with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.
- Avoids mixing logic from multiple domains.

üß† *Example*: One service for "User Management", another for "Order Processing".

---

### 2. **Independently Deployable**
- Each service can be **deployed, updated, or scaled independently**.
- Reduces deployment risk and increases agility.

üöÄ *Benefit*: No need to redeploy the entire system when one service changes.

---

### 3. **Decentralized Data Management**
- Each microservice owns its **own database**.
- Prevents tight coupling and enforces separation.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Note*: No shared DB between services. Use APIs or messaging to communicate.

---

### 4. **Communication via APIs or Messaging**
- Services communicate over **lightweight protocols**:
    - **RESTful APIs** over HTTP
    - **Asynchronous messaging** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)

üí¨ *Rule*: Prefer asynchronous communication for scalability.

---

### 5. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**
- Each service must be **designed to fail gracefully**.
- Use patterns like:
    - **Circuit Breaker**
    - **Retries**
    - **Fallbacks**

üîÅ *Tools*: Netflix Hystrix, Resilience4j

---

### 6. **Scalability**
- Each microservice can be **scaled independently** based on load.
- Helps optimize infrastructure usage and costs.

üìà *Example*: Scale ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù service during sales without scaling the entire system.

---

### 7. **Continuous Delivery and DevOps Alignment**
- Encourages **CI/CD pipelines** for fast, reliable deployments.
- Supports **automation**, testing, monitoring, and rollback strategies.

üß™ *Tools*: Jenkins, GitLab CI, ArgoCD

---

### 8. **Technology Agnostic / Polyglot Persistence**
- Services can be written in **different languages** or use **different data stores**.
- Promotes use of the best tools for each service's needs.

üõ†Ô∏è *Example*: Java for one service, Node.js for another.

---

### 9. **Observability (Logging, Metrics, Tracing)**
- Each service must have:
    - **Centralized logging** (e.g., ELK, Fluentd)
    - **Metrics collection** (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana)
    - **Distributed tracing** (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin)

üîç Helps with **debugging and performance monitoring**.

---

### 10. **Security**
- Secure **communication between services** (e.g., mTLS in Istio).
- Use **authentication/authorization mechanisms** like OAuth2, JWT.

üõ°Ô∏è *Practice*: Secure APIs with gateways and apply **zero trust** principles.

---

Great! Here's a **visual diagram** and **real-world example** to help you understand how these microservices principles come together in practice.

## **Design Patterns in Micro Service :**

## **Event Driven Architecture Pattern :** 

EDA pattern

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

traditional synchronous communication via rest/http

tightly coupled interactions

EDA : offers a streamlined alternative by decoupling services using events. more scalable and efficient system design

![img_2.png](img_2.png)

![img_3.png](img_3.png)

![img_4.png](img_4.png)

![img_5.png](img_5.png)

best way is to use event driven architecture + syschronous communication where ever needed

eg : EDA + SERVICE MESH

![img_6.png](img_6.png)

scalability is one of the primary reasons, companies adapt to event driven architecture

![img_7.png](img_7.png)

![img_8.png](img_8.png)

![img_9.png](img_9.png)

Challenges in EDA :

![img_10.png](img_10.png)

KAFKA, RABBITMQ , AMAZON SQS


## **Circuit Breaker Pattern :** 

![img_12.png](img_12.png)

even when some of the services are experiencing problem , it will allow the system to function without fail. 

Retry pattern - tries again - best for transient failures (temporary failures)

![img_13.png](img_13.png)

![img_14.png](img_14.png)

if the threshold reaches, then it will moved to open state

![img_15.png](img_15.png)

after a timeout of period, it goes into half open state, 

![img_16.png](img_16.png)

Netflix Hytrix - old
Resilience4j - very good and light weight


## **Saga Pattern  : Distributed Transactions** 

![img_17.png](img_17.png)

![img_18.png](img_18.png)

![img_19.png](img_19.png)

![img_20.png](img_20.png)

![img_21.png](img_21.png)

2 phases -
in preparation phase - cooardinator sends a request to prepare for commit of transaction to all the involved services
if the reply is yes then goes to next phase. if not stops here

in commit phase : cooardinator sends a commit requiest to all services, to permanently store. if something fails, then all the
other services also rollback

eg of this algorithm is : Apache ZooKeeper


Disadvantages :
![img_22.png](img_22.png)

everything is dependant on co-oardinator. if it dies then enter into deadlock
![img_23.png](img_23.png)


Mitigation :

![img_24.png](img_24.png)

ensuring consistency is a critical challenge

thats why distributed transactions. a group of  transactions are considered as a single unit of work.
either all units succeed, or none will


thats why sagas offer a more effective way.

![img_25.png](img_25.png)

if any service fails, then compensating actions can be executed.

breaks down into local transactions and each is responsible for a single task. and they communicate with each other through events.
![img_26.png](img_26.png)

![img_27.png](img_27.png)

Orchestrated saga :

saga orchestrator waits for each saga to send a response, before moving to the next saga.

![img_28.png](img_28.png)


![img_30.png](img_30.png)

in coreoghraphed saga, there is no central orchestrator, each participants communicate through events, listening to each other


![img_31.png](img_31.png)

![img_32.png](img_32.png)

![img_33.png](img_33.png)

![img_34.png](img_34.png)


## **Strangler Pattern :**

moving from monolithic to micro services .

strangle the old system over time to move to micro services

![img_35.png](img_35.png)

![img_36.png](img_36.png)

in-line with Aggregation architecture.

key point is that.. both monolyth and micro services live together for a period of time

![img_37.png](img_37.png)

![img_38.png](img_38.png)

service discovery tools - eureka
service mesh - istio


## Data Per Service Pattern : 

![img_39.png](img_39.png)


different types :

![img_40.png](img_40.png)

![img_41.png](img_41.png)

multiple schemas can exist in same db, but are isolated from one another.

![img_42.png](img_42.png)

![img_43.png](img_43.png)

higher latency and poor experience

![img_44.png](img_44.png)

Challenges :

Data Consistency

![img_45.png](img_45.png)


![img_46.png](img_46.png)

to address these challenges, pair it with event driven architecture.


## **Aggregator Pattern :** 

![img_47.png](img_47.png)

acts as a co-ordinator for collecting responses and combining them into single result

![img_48.png](img_48.png)

![img_49.png](img_49.png)

offen works hand in hand with another pattern : CQRS 

![img_50.png](img_50.png)

NEWS app... fetching multiple responses and delivering to user. one output is independent of other's


output of one service becomes request of the other. dependency.

![img_51.png](img_51.png)

branch pattern similar to scatter-gather but based on the responses received, allows different processing paths. 
eg : if flight booking failed, hotel booking also fail, if success, then hotel also success.

![img_52.png](img_52.png)

Challenges :

![img_53.png](img_53.png)

![img_54.png](img_54.png)

## **Side Car Pattern :** 

![img_55.png](img_55.png)

use : services focus on purely business logic. while side car takes care of the rest (load balancing, logging, communication, security, monitoring)

![img_56.png](img_56.png)

![img_57.png](img_57.png)

![img_58.png](img_58.png)

![img_59.png](img_59.png)
